# layout_bot
Telegram bot that switches keyboard layout in sent messages.

You can find it here: https://t.me/RusLayoutBot.

You can send messages directly to the bot or it can work inline.

It is not a serious project, this bot was created for my boyfriend who always forgets to change keyboard layout from English to Russian and frequently sents me something like "ns ghtrhfcytqitt cjplfybt".
